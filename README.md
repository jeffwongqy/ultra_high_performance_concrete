## Tree-Based Regression for Predicting Compressive Strength of High-Ultra Performance Concrete

**High-Ultra Performance Concrete (UHPC)** is a highly advanced construction material known for its exceptional strength and durability. However, accurately predicting its compressive strength is challenging due to its complex composition and the intricate interactions among its ingredients.

This project focuses on leveraging tree-based regression models to predict the compressive strength of UHPC. Tree-based methods such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Decision Trees are well-suited for capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between variables, making them ideal for this application.

Future Work (TBC): 
- Exploration of possible feature engineering and feature selection techniques
- Exploration improves prediction performance on linear modeling such as linear regression. 
- Integrate models with web apps such as Streamlit or Gradio
